Hey, I'm T., but you can call me Ryuzy. I used to be an experienced product developer in fintech and blockchain, building and consulting on software and hardware wallets. I'm now retired from that and developing open-source products.

You can find me developing apps and libraries based on TypeScript, Svelte, SvelteKit, Go, and Rust.

Be sure to check out my current project, Grinta, at https://getgrinta.com.
